## Introduction

AstraUI Web is designed to help you build accessible and responsive web applications quickly. Each component is built with accessibility and best practices in mind, leveraging [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/) standards to ensure that your applications are usable by everyone, including those with disabilities. By adhering to these standards, AstraUI Web helps developers create web applications that are not only visually appealing but also inclusive and compliant with accessibility guidelines.

## Components

AstraUI Web includes a variety of components to streamline your web development process. For a complete list of components and their documentation, please visit the [Components](https://www.astraui.design/components) section.

## Design Principles

AstraUI is designed in four core design principles that guide the development and use of the system:

### Consistent

AstraUI ensures all components adhere to a unified design system, providing a cohesive look and feel across applications. Consistency is key to maintaining visual and functional harmony, governed by guidelines on color palettes, typography, motion, and component behavior. By following these standards, developers and designers can create visually appealing and intuitive interfaces. This consistency builds a recognizable brand identity and enhances user experience through familiar interaction patterns.

### Reusable

AstraUI components are designed for easy reuse across projects, increasing efficiency and reducing redundant code. Each standalone, modular component can be integrated into multiple projects with minimal effort, ensuring a consistent look and feel while reducing development time. This reuse also facilitates collaboration, allowing teams to easily share and leverage the same components. Additionally, AstraUI components are built with scalability in mind, ensuring they work seamlessly across screen sizes and devices.

### Accessible

Built on top of [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/), AstraUI is built with accessibility at its core, ensuring seamless interaction for all users. By prioritizing inclusive design, AstraUI creates interfaces that meet a variety of needs. Leveraging the WAI-ARIA specification, AstraUI ensures that its components are fully accessible, complying with WCAG guidelines by properly managing focus, keyboard interactions, and ARIA attributes. This commitment enhances both usability and robustness, making AstraUI a reliable choice for everyone.

### Customizable

AstraUI components are highly customizable to meet specific needs and branding guidelines. Each component offers a flexible yet robust system that allows for extensive customization across various aspects such as themes, styles, typography, gestures, and other visual attributes, allowing developers and designers to override defaults and apply custom styles for their product. This empowers developers and designers to create unique, branded user interfaces without compromising component integrity.
